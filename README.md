# Library Simplified Data Store

This is the Data Store for [Library Simplified](http://www.librarysimplified.org/). The data store contains information from a variety of sources, supporting the accurate classification and thorough metadata of book records.

The [Metadata Wrangler](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/metadata-wrangler) depends on the data store for its installation.

## Installation & Workflow

Thorough deployment instructions, including essential libraries for Linux systems, can be found [in the Library Simplified wiki](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS/wiki/Deployment-Instructions). **_If this is your first time installing a Library Simplified repository, please review those instructions._**

Should you need to work on the data store, use a traditional git workflow:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:NYPL-Simplified/data.git data
```

If you are using the data store in conjunction with the Metadata Wrangler, be sure to include its full local path as the value of the "data_directory" property in your metadata configuration json file.
